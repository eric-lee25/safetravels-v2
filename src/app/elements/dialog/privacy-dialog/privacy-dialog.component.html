      you to share your emergency contact and medical details with others through our platform. Just create a profile,
      add contacts and decide who you want to share your information with.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect
        information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with
        SafeTravels services (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>“), and your choices about the collection and
        use of your information.
      </li>
      <li>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post information,
        including emergency contact information, medical conditions, photos, and other materials (“<strong>User
          Content</strong>“), to the Service and to share User Content with other users. This means that other Users may
        search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service,
        consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at
        www.safetravels.com).
      </li>
      <li>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“<strong>Users</strong>“).</li>

      <li>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for a SafeTravels account.</li>
      <li>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number).
        This information allows us to help you or others be “found” on SafeTravels
      </li>
      <li>User Content (e.g., contact information, emergency contact information, travel insurance details.)</li>
      <li>Communications between you and SafeTravels. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account

        opt out of Service-related e-mails.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Finding your friends on SafeTravels:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you choose, you can use our “Find friends” feature to locate other people with SafeTravels accounts either
        through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names on
        SafeTravels.<p></p>
      </li>
      <li> If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to
        set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide
        to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.<p></p>
      </li>
      <li> If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on SafeTravels then simply
        type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.<p></p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Note about “Invite Friends” feature:</strong>&nbsp;If you choose to invite someone to the Service
        through our “Invite friends” feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and
        send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible for any
        charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from
        your personal account, SafeTravels does not have access to or control this communication.<p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li> We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools
        collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other
        information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with
        analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular
        individual User.<p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li> When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local
        storage to collect information about how you use SafeTravels and provide features to you.<p></p>
      </li>
      <li> We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or
        similar technologies placed by us or the third party.<p></p>
      </li>
      <li> If you don’t want to receive certain categories of cookies on the Services, you can opt-out of them. We will
        need to set a cookie so that we can remember your choices when you next visit the website from the same browser.
        At the present time it is not technically possible for us to allow you to carry your settings with you between
        your browsers and devices so you will need to change these settings from each browser you use.<p></p>
      </li>
      <li>Please also be aware that we make every effort to respect your choices, however, there is the possibility that
        not all cookies will be captured. If this is a concern then we would recommend that you change your cookie
        settings via your browser; your browser help function will tell you how.<p></p>
      </li>
      <li> Please note that you may lose some functionality if you choose to disable cookies. We use the following types
        of cookies:<p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>(a) Strictly necessary cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to enable you to move about the site or to
      provide certain features you have requested.</p>
    <p>(b) Functionality cookies: These cookies enhance the functionality of website by storing your preferences.</p>
    <p>(c) Performance cookies: These cookies help to improve the performance of the website, providing a better user
      experience.</p>
    <p>(d) Online behavioural advertising cookies: These cookies are for the international version of the website which
      features advertising. They are used to tailor the advertising to each user.</p>
    <p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <p></p>
      <li>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e.,
        visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your
        browser or device.<p></p>
        <p></p></li>
      <li>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web
        request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and
        how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such
        information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track
        which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate
        reporting and improvement of the Service.<p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <p></p>
      <li>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor,
        store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data
        files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your
        mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in
        connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by SafeTravels.
        <p></p>
        <p></p></li>
      <li>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the
        Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service
        may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.<p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <p></p>
      <li>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe
        how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.<p></p>
        <p></p></li>
      <li>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords
        when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your
        User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using
        other’s APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a
        location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.<p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
    <p>We may personal information only to our service providers who assist us in operating the Services and the
      relevant Tour Companies. We will only disclose personal information to an unrelated third party with your
      consent.</p>
    <p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <p></p>
      <li>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log
        files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same
        group of companies that SafeTravels is part of, or that become part of that group (“Affiliates”). Affiliates may
        use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and
        Affiliates’ own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). But these
        Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your photos.<p></p>
        <p></p></li>
      <li>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device
        identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you (“Service
        Providers”). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to
        provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.<p></p>
        <p></p></li>
      <li>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This
        information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that
        they believe will be of most interest to you.<p></p>
        <p></p></li>
      <li>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also
        combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that
        aggregated information.<p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Apart from such circumstances, we may disclose personal information in special situations where we have reason to
      believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring or
      interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, users or anyone else who could be
      harmed by such activities.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We may also disclose personal information as required by law.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the event that we sell or buy businesses or their assets, or engage in transfers, acquisitions, mergers,
      restructurings, changes of control and other similar transactions, customer information is generally one of the
      transferable business assets. Thus, your personal information may be subject to such a transfer. In the unlikely
      event of insolvency, personal information may be transferred to a trustee or debtor in possession and then to a
      subsequent purchaser.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you voluntarily provide information in publicly accessible areas of the Services, the information can be
      viewed and therefore used by others. We advise users not to disclose contact information that they do not wish to
      have publicly available. We are not responsible for personal information you choose to submit publicly.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content,
        becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your
        privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you have shared User Content or made
        it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.
      </li>
      <li>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived
        pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the SafeTravels API have copied or saved that
        information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of SafeTravels or our assets to another organization (e.g.,
        in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your
        information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected through the Service
        may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee
        will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant,
        court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include
        responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the Australia where we have a good faith belief that
        the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with
        internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good
        faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect
        ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
        Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it
        is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning
        possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.
      </li>

        SafeTravels or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
